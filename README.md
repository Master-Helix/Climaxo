-> Functional Concepts of React JS like, Components, Fat Arrow Function, Map have been used together with API key connected to it and is called inside the functin when users enters the desired city for displaying the parameters of the data.<br>
->The Node Modules folder is also required to be downloaded while creating the react app and few Libraries have been imported using NPM (Node Packet Manager) like FIREBASE (I used it for Hosting my application) . <br>
